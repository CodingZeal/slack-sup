# slack-sup

## Purpose

`slack-sup` is an apprenticeship project of mine and its purpose is to coordinate weekly S'up meetings between the team members at Zeal.  Currently, S'up meetings are coordinated through email.  The goal of this app is to create multi-person direct messages between the selected groups in Slack each week to initiate the meetings.
